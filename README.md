# Overview

Simple Task Manager application written in Kotlin. Tasks can be added and marked completed through a console menu. All files are saved to a file on exit, and on startup they are read from that file to have continuity between sessions. 

Software was written to learn Kotlin core for my long-term goal of developing mobile applications for Android. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
