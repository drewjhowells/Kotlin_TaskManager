# Overview

Simple Task Manager application written in Kotlin. Tasks can be added and marked completed through a console menu. All tasks are saved to a file on exit, and on startup they are read from that file to have continuity between sessions. 

Software was written to learn Kotlin core for my long-term goal of developing mobile applications for Android.
